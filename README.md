1.Count_down_timer.

The timer is set to countdown to March 1, 2023 at 12:00:00. You can adjust the date and time to suit your needs. The code uses the setInterval function to update the countdown every 1 second. The countdown is displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and if the countdown is over, a message is displayed saying "EXPIRED".

2.Password_generator.

The password generator takes an input for the length of the password and a button to generate the password. The generatePassword function uses a string of characters that includes lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters to generate a random password of the specified length. The password is displayed in an input field with the placeholder "Password". You can adjust the character set to include different types of characters or adjust the length range to suit your needs.

3.Simple_calculator.

The calculator takes two input values (num1 and num2) and four buttons (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide) to perform the four basic arithmetic operations. The getInputValues function retrieves the values entered in the input fields and returns them as an array. The displayResult function sets the value of the result input field to the given value. The add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions perform the corresponding arithmetic operations and display the result.

4.Voice_to_Speech_rcognition_system.

The text-to-speech feature allows the user to input text in a text area and then hear the text spoken aloud by clicking the "Speak" button. The speech recognition feature allows the user to speak into the microphone and see the spoken text displayed on the screen. The speak function creates a new SpeechSynthesisUtterance object with the input text and uses the speechSynthesis global variable to speak the text. The speech recognition feature uses the webkitSpeechRecognition object to recognize speech input and display the recognized text on the screen. The lang property sets the language for speech recognition, and interimResults is set to true to allow for live updates of recognized text as it is being spoken. The onresult function is called when speech is recognized and outputs the recognized text on the screen. The onerror function logs any errors that may occur during speech recognition, and the onend function restarts speech recognition after it has stopped.
