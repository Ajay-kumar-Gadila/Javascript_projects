1.Count_down_timer.

The timer is set to countdown to March 1, 2023 at 12:00:00. You can adjust the date and time to suit your needs. The code uses the setInterval function to update the countdown every 1 second. The countdown is displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and if the countdown is over, a message is displayed saying "EXPIRED".

2.Password_generator.

The password generator takes an input for the length of the password and a button to generate the password. The generatePassword function uses a string of characters that includes lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters to generate a random password of the specified length. The password is displayed in an input field with the placeholder "Password". You can adjust the character set to include different types of characters or adjust the length range to suit your needs.

3.Simple_calculator.

The calculator takes two input values (num1 and num2) and four buttons (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide) to perform the four basic arithmetic operations. The getInputValues function retrieves the values entered in the input fields and returns them as an array. The displayResult function sets the value of the result input field to the given value. The add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions perform the corresponding arithmetic operations and display the result.
